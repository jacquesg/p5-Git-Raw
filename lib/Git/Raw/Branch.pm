=head1 NAME

Git::Raw::Branch - Git branch class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Git::Raw;

    # open the Git repository at $path
    my $repo = Git::Raw::Repository -> open($path);

    # create a new branch named 'some_branch'
    $repo -> branch('some_branch', $repo -> head -> target);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Helper class for branch manipulation. Note that a Git branch is nothing more
than a L<Git::Raw::Reference>, so this class inherits all methods from it.

B<WARNING>: The API of this module is unstable and may change without warning
(any change will be appropriately documented in the changelog).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 create( $repo, $name, $target )

Create a new branch given a name and a target object (either a
L<Git::Raw::Commit> or a L<Git::Raw::Tag>).

=head2 lookup( $repo, $name, $is_local )

Retrieve the branch corresponding to the given branch name.

=head2 move( $name, $force )

Rename the branch to C<$name>. Note that in order to get the updated branch
object, an additional C<Git::Raw::Branch-E<gt>lookup()> is needed.

=head2 upstream( )

Retrieve the reference supporting the remote tracking branch, given the local
branch. If there is no corresponding supporting reference, this function will
return C<undef>.

=head2 upstream_name( )

Return the name of the reference supporting the remote tracking branch, given
the the local branch.

=head2 remote_name( )

Return the name of remote that the remote tracking branch belongs to, given
the local branch.

=head2 is_head( )

Check if the current local branch is pointed at by HEAD.
