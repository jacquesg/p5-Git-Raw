=head2 clear_refspecs( )

Clear the remote's refspecs.

=head2 refspec_count( )

=head2 refspecs( )

Retrieve the remote's refspecs. Returns a list of C<Git::Raw::RefSpec> objects.

=head2 ls( )

Retrieve the list of refs at the remote. Returns a hash reference containing
C<key => value> pairs where the key is the name of the reference, and the value
is a hash reference containing the following values:

=over 4

=item * "local"

Whether the reference exists locally.

=item * "id"

(currently unused).

=item * "transfer_progress"

During the download of new data, this will be regularly called with the current
count of progress done by the indexer. The callback receives the following integers:
C<total_objects>, C<received_objects>, C<local_objects>, C<total_deltas>,
C<indexed_deltas> and C<received_bytes>.

=item * "update_tips"

Each time a reference is updated locally, this function will be called with
information about it. The callback receives a string containing the name of the
