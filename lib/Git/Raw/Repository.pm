=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Git::Raw::Repository> represents a Git repository.

B<WARNING>: The API of this module is unstable and may change without warning
(any change will be appropriately documented in the changelog).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init( $path, $is_bare )

Initialize a new repository at C<$path>.

=head2 clone( $url, $path, \%opts )

Clone the repository at C<$url> to C<$path>. Valid fields for the C<%opts> hash
are:

=over 4

=item * "bare"

If true (default is false) create a bare repository.

=item * "remote_name"

The name to be given to the "origin" remote (default is "origin").

=item * "checkout_branch"

The name of the branch to checkout (default is to use the remote's HEAD).

=item * "ignore_cert_errors"

If true (default is false) ignore errors validating the remote host's certificate.

=item * "disable_checkout"

If true (default is false) files will not be checked out after the clone completes.

=item * "callbacks"

=over 8

=item * "credentials"

The callback to be called any time authentication is required to connect to the
remote repository. The callback receives a string containing the URL of the
remote, and it must return a L<Git::Raw::Cred> object.

=item * "progress"

Textual progress from the remote. Text send over the progress side-band will be
passed to this function (this is the 'counting objects' output). The callback
receives a string containing progress information.

=item * "completion"

Completion is called when different parts of the download process are done
(currently unused).

=item * "transfer_progress"

During the download of new data, this will be regularly called with the current
count of progress done by the indexer. The callback receives the following integers:
C<total_objects>, C<received_objects>, C<local_objects>, C<total_deltas>,
C<indexed_deltas> and C<received_bytes>.

=item * "update_tips"

Each time a reference is updated locally, this function will be called with
information about it. The callback receives a string containing the name of the
reference that was updated, and the two OID's C<"a"> before and C<"b"> after the update.

=back

=back

=head2 open( $path )

Open the repository at C<$path>.

=head2 discover( $path )

Discover the path to the repository directory given a subdirectory.

=head2 new( )

Create a new repository with neither backends nor config object.

=head2 config( )

Retrieve the default L<Git::Raw::Config> of the repository.

=head2 index( )

Retrieve the default L<Git::Raw::Index> of the repository.

=head2 head( [$new_head] )

Retrieve the L<Git::Raw::Reference> pointed by the HEAD of the repository. If
the L<Git::Raw::Reference> C<$new_head> is passed, the HEAD of the repository
will be changed to point to it.

=head2 lookup( $id )

Retrieve the object corresponding to C<$id>.

=head2 checkout( $object, \%opts )

Updates the files in the index and working tree to match the content of
C<$object>. Valid fields for the C<%opts> hash are:

=over 4

=item * "checkout_strategy"

Hash representing the desired checkout strategy. Valid fields are:

=over 8

=item * "none"

Dry-run checkout strategy. It doesn't make any changes, but checks for
conflicts.

=item * "force"

Take any action to make the working directory match the target (pretty much the
opposite of C<"none">.

=item * "safe"

Make only modifications that will not lose changes (to be used in order to
simulate C<git checkout>.

=item * "safe_create"

Like C<"safe">, but will also cause a file to be checked out if it is missing
from the working directory even if it is not modified between the target and
baseline (to be used in order to simulate C<git checkout-index> and C<git clone>).

=item * "allow_conflicts"

Apply safe updates even if there are conflicts.

=item * "remove_untracked"

Remove untracked files from the working directory.

=item * "remove_ignored"

Remove ignored files from the working directory.

=item * "update_only"

Only update files that already exists (files won't be created not deleted).

=item * "dont_update_index"

Do not write the updated files' info to the index.

=item * "no_refresh"

Do not reload the index and git attrs from disk before operations.

=item * "skip_unmerged"

Skip files with unmerged index entries, instead of treating them as conflicts.

=back

=item * "notify"

Notification flags for the notify callback. A list of the following options:

=over 8

=item * "conflict"

Notifies about conflicting paths.

=item * "dirty"

Notifies about file that don't need an update but no longer matches the baseline.
Core git displays these files when checkout runs, but won't stop the checkout.

=item * "updated"

Notification on any file changed.

=item * "untracked"

Notification about untracked files.

=item * "ignored"

Notifies about ignored files.

=item * "all"

All of the above.

=back

=item * "callbacks"

Hash containg progress and notification callbacks. Valid fields are:

=over 8

=item * "notify"

This callback is called for each file matching one of the C<notify> options selected.
It runs before modifying any files on disk. This callback should return a non-zero value
should the checkout be cancelled.  The callback receives a string containing the path
of the file C<path> and an array reference containing the reason C<why>.

=item * "progress"

The callback to be invoked as a file is checked out. The callback receives a string
containing the path of the file C<path>, an integer C<completed_steps> and an
integer C<total_steps>.

=back

=item * "paths"

An optional array representing the list of files thay should be checked out. If
C<"paths"> is not specified, all files will be checked out (default).

=back

Example:

    $repo -> checkout($repo -> head -> target, {
      'checkout_strategy' => { 'safe'  => 1 },
      'notify'    => [ 'all' ],
      'callbacks' => {
         'notify' => sub {
           my ($path, $why) = @_;

           print "File: $path: ", join(' ', @$why), "\n";
         },
         'progress' => sub {
            my ($path, $completed_steps, $total_steps) = @_;

            print "File: $path", "\n" if defined ($path);
            print "Progress: $completed_steps/$total_steps", "\n";
         }
      },
      'paths' => [ 'myscript.pl' ]
    });

=head2 reset( $target, \%opts )

Reset the current HEAD to the given commit. Valid fields for the C<%opts>
hash are:

=over 4

=item * "type"

Set the type of the reset to be performed. Valid values are: C<"soft"> (the head
will be moved to the commit), C<"mixed"> (trigger a soft reset and replace the
index with the content of the commit tree) or C<"hard"> (trigger a C<"mixed">
reset and the working directory will be replaced with the content of the index).

=item * "paths"

List of entries in the index to be updated from the target commit tree.  This is
particularly useful to implement L<"git reset HEAD -- file file"> behaviour.
Note, if this parameter is specified, a value of C<"mixed"> will be used for
C<"type"> (setting C<"type"> to C<"soft"> or C<"hard"> has no effect).

=back

=head2 status( [$file, $file, ...] )

Retrieve the status of files in the index and/or working directory. This functions
returns a hash reference with an entry for each C<$file>, or all files if no file
parameters are provided. Each <$file> entry has a list of C<"flags">, which may
include: C<"index_new">, C<"index_modified">, C<"index_deleted">, C<"index_renamed">,
C<"worktree_new">, C<"worktree_modified">, C<"worktree_deleted">,
C<"worktree_renamed"> and C<"ignored">.

If C<$file> has been renamed in either the index or worktree or both, C<$file> will
also have a corresponding entry C<"index"> and/or C<"worktree">, containing the
previous filename C<"old_file">.

Example:

    my $file_statuses = $repo -> status();
    while (my ($file, $status) = each %$file_statuses) {
      my $flags = $status -> {'flags'};
      print "File: $file: Status: ", join (' ', @$flags), "\n";

      if (grep { $_ eq 'index_renamed' } @$flags) {
        print "Index previous filename: ",
        $status -> {'index'} -> {'old_file'}, "\n";
      }

      if (grep { $_ eq 'worktree_renamed' } @$flags) {
        print "Worktree previous filename: ",
        $status -> {'worktree'} -> {'old_file'}, "\n";
      }
    }

=head2 merge( $ref, \%opts)
