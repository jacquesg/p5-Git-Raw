=head1 NAME

Git::Raw::Index - Git index class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<Git::Raw::Index> represents an index in a Git repository.

B<WARNING>: The API of this module is unstable and may change without warning
(any change will be appropriately documented in the changelog).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( )

Create a new in memory index. This is currently of little use.

=head2 owner( )

Retrieve the L<Git::Raw::Repository> owning the index.

=head2 add( $entry )

Add C<$entry> to the index. C<$entry> should either be the path of a file
or alternatively a L<Git::Raw::Index::Entry>.

=head2 add_frombuffer( $path, $buffer, [$mode] )

Add or update an entry from an in memory file. The entry will be placed at C<$path>
with the contents of C<$buffer>. C<$buffer> may either be string or a reference
to a string. C<$mode> is the file mode; it defaults to C<0100644>. Returns a
L<Git::Raw::Index::Entry> object.

=head2 add_all( \%opts )

Add or update all index entries to match the working directory. Valid fields for
the C<%opts> hash are:

=over 4

=item * "paths"

List of path patterns to add.

=item * "flags"

Valid fields for the C<%flags> member:

=over 8

=item * "force"

Forced addition of files (even if they are ignored).

=item * "disable_pathspec_match"

Disable pathspec pattern matching against entries in C<$paths>.

=item * "check_pathspec"

Enable pathspec pattern matching against entries in C<$paths> (default).

=back

=item * "notification"

The callback to be called for each added or updated item. Receives the C<$path>
and matching C<$pathspec>. This callback should return C<0> if the file should
be added to the index, C<E<gt>0> if it should be skipped or C<E<lt>0> to abort.

=back

=head2 find( $path )

Find the first L<Git::Raw::Index::Entry> which point to given C<$path>. If an
entry cannot be found, this function will return C<undef>.

=head2 remove( $path )

Remove C<$path> from the index.

=head2 remove_all( \%opts )

Remove all matching index entries. See C<Git::Raw::Index-E<gt>update_all()> for
valid C<%opts> values.

=head2 path( )

Retrieve the full path to the index file on disk.

=head2 checksum( )

Retrieve the SHA-1 checksum over the index file, except for the last 20 bytes which is the checksum content itself.
In the index does not exist on-disk an empty OID will be returned.

=head2 clear( )

Clear the index.

=head2 read( [$force] )

Update the index reading it from disk.

=head2 write( )

Write the index to disk.

=head2 read_tree( $tree )

Replace the index contente with C<$tree>.

=head2 write_tree( [$repo] )

Create a new tree from the index and write it to disk. C<$repo> optionally
indicates which L<Git::Raw::Repository> the tree should be written to. Returns
a L<Git::Raw::Tree> object.

=head2 checkout( [\%checkout_opts] )

Update files in the working tree to match the contents of the index.
See C<Git::Raw::Repository-E<gt>checkout()> for valid
C<%checkout_opts> values.

=head2 entry_count( )

Retrieve the number of entries in the index.

=head2 entries( )

Retrieve index entries. Returns a list of L<Git::Raw::Index::Entry> objects.

=head2 add_conflict( $ancestor, $theirs, $ours)

Add a new conflict entry. C<$ancestor>, C<$theirs> and C<$ours> should be
L<Git::Raw::Index::Entry> objects.

=head2 get_conflict( $path )

Get the conflict entry for C<$path>. If C<$path> has no conflict entry,
this function will return C<undef>.

=head2 remove_conflict( $path )

Remove C<$path> from the index.

=head2 has_conflicts( )

Determine if the index contains entries representing file conflicts.

=head2 conflict_cleanup( )

Remove all conflicts in the index (entries with a stage greater than 0).

=head2 conflicts( )

Retrieve index entries that represent a conflict. Returns a list of
L<Git::Raw::Index::Conflict> objects.

=head2 merge( $ancestor, $theirs, $ours, [\%merge_opts] )

Merge two files as they exist in the index. C<$ancestor>, C<$theirs> and
C<$ours> should be L<Git::Raw::Index::Entry> objects. Returns a
L<Git::Raw::Merge::File::Result> object. Valid fields for the C<%merge_opts>
hash are:

=over 4

=item * "our_label"

The name of the "our" side of conflicts.

=item * "their_label"

The name of the "their" side of conflicts.

=item * "ancestor_label"

The name of the common ancestor side of conflicts.

=item * "favor"

Specify content automerging behaviour. Valid values are C<"ours">, C<"theirs">,
and C<"union">.

=item * "flags"

Merge file flags. Valid values include:

=over 8

=item * "merge"

Create standard conflicted merge file.

=item * "diff3"

Create diff3-style files.

=item * "simplify_alnum"

Condense non-alphanumeric regions for simplified diff file.

=item * "ignore_whitespace"

Ignore all whitespace.

=item * "ignore_whitespace_change"

Ignore changes in amount of whitespace.

=item * "ignore_whitespace_eol"

Ignore whitespace at end of line.

=item * "patience"

Use the C<"patience diff"> algorithm.

=item * "minimal"

Take extra time to find minimal diff.

=back

=back

=head2 update_all( \%opts )

Update all index entries to match the working directory. Valid fields for the
C<%opts> hash are:

=over 4

=item * "paths"

List of path patterns to add.

=item * "notification"

The callback to be called for each updated item. Receives the C<$path> and
matching C<$pathspec>. This callback should return C<0> if the file should be
added to the index, C<E<gt>0> if it should be skipped or C<E<lt>0> to abort.

=back

=head2 capabilities( )

Retrieve the index's capabilities. Returns a hash with members C<"ignore_case">,
C<"no_filemode"> and C<"no_symlinks">, each indicating if the L<Git::Raw::Index>
supports the capability.

=head2 version( [$version] )

Retrieve or set the index version.
